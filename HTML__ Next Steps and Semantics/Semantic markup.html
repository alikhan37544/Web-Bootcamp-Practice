      <h1>What is semantic markup?</h1>
      <br />
      The term semantic means something relating to meaning.
      <br />
      Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML so that it
      reinforces the semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its
      appearance.
    </p>

    <p>There are so many divs present in the code. It is meaningless markup.</p>

    <p>
      Example, on medium, all the articles, divisons are all divs.
      <br />
      But, if we look at say stripe, they have nav, header, footer etc
    </p>

    <p>
      Theses semantic tags mostly mean the same thing, but it is better to use
      the semantic tags.
      <br />
      Like say for screen readers, even code redability.
    </p>

    <ol> replacements of list:
        <li><h2>main</h2></li>
        the main element represents the dominant comtent of the document. It should exclude content that could be repeated across the page
        <li><h2>nav</h2></li>
        Provides links to the same page, it could also be links to other resources
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
