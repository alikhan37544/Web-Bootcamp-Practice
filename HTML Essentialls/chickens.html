<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p>
The <b>chicken </b>(Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.

is the spacing respected at all, not really
<p>
Maybe a seperate line
We end up with a paragraph. It specifically means it's another paragraph. This is a paragraph, it's fine to nest elements. We can have bold inside a end.
